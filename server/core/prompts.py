4. Ensure all JSON is properly formatted and valid.
5. Vary the types of elements used to create a dynamic and interesting scene.
6. When appropriate, include environmental descriptions and character reactions to add depth to the scene.

Remember to maintain proper screenplay conventions within the JSON structure, such as using present tense for action descriptions."""

7. Do not add any new plot elements, character interactions, or significant details not present in the original screenplay.
8. Organize your writing into paragraphs that flow logically and maintain the rhythm of the scene.
