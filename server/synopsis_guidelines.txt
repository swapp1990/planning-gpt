# Chapter Synopsis Guidelines

1. Length and Conciseness:
   - Keep the synopsis between 2-4 sentences.
   - Focus on the most crucial elements of the chapter.

2. Key Elements to Include:
   - Main plot developments
   - Significant character actions or decisions
   - Important revelations or discoveries
   - Any major conflicts or obstacles introduced or resolved

3. Character Focus:
   - Highlight the chapter's central character(s)
   - Briefly mention any new characters introduced
   - Note any significant character development or changes

4. Setting and Atmosphere:
   - If relevant, briefly describe the setting or any change in location
   - Capture the overall mood or atmosphere of the chapter

5. Narrative Progression:
   - Show how the chapter advances the overall story
   - Indicate how it builds upon previous chapters
   - Hint at future developments or unresolved questions

6. Thematic Elements:
   - Touch on any major themes explored in the chapter
   - Highlight symbolism or motifs, if significant

7. Consistency and Style:
   - Maintain a consistent tone across all synopses
   - Use present tense for immediacy (e.g., "John discovers" not "John discovered")
   - Avoid overly flowery language; aim for clarity and precision

8. Spoiler Awareness:
   - Include major plot points but avoid revealing all surprises
   - Strike a balance between informative and intriguing

9. Chapter-Specific Focus:
   - Ensure each synopsis is unique to its chapter
   - Avoid generalities that could apply to multiple chapters

10. Structural Considerations:
    - For early chapters, emphasize setup and character introduction
    - For middle chapters, focus on complications and deepening conflicts
    - For later chapters, highlight escalating tensions and movement towards resolution

11. Pacing Reflection:
    - Let the synopsis reflect the pacing of the chapter
    - For action-heavy chapters, use more dynamic language
    - For slower, character-focused chapters, emphasize emotional states or decisions

12. Cohesion with Chapter Title:
    - Ensure the synopsis aligns with and expands upon the chapter title

13. Act Awareness:
    - Subtly indicate how the chapter fits into its designated act (setup, confrontation, or resolution)

Remember: A good synopsis should give a clear idea of what happens in the chapter while also making the reader curious to know more.
